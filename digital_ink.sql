(1, 'Pixar\'s Up Movie', 'Love is in the air.', 'Love is beutiful.', 'first-post', 'Young Carl Fredricksen (Jeremy Leary), a quiet bespectacled boy wearing an old pilot\'s cap and goggles, watches a film reel in a theater depicting his hero Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), a famous explorer. The reporter speaks of Muntz\'s various accomplishments and discoveries before commenting that he was recently dishonored by scientists who believed his latest find, the large skeleton of a bird, was a hoax. Intent on proving them wrong, Muntz is seen boarding his zeppelin with his team of dogs and promises to return once he has brought back living proof of his find. After the show, Carl runs down the street with his balloon, named after Muntzs zeppelin The Spirit of Adventure. He passes an old, rundown house where he hears someone shout out Muntz\'s famous slogan: Adventure is out there!\r\n\r\nCarl goes inside to investigate and meets a young, outgoing tomboy who shares his passion for exploration and admiration of Charles Muntz. Startled by her loud, boyish demeanor at first, Carl loses his balloon in the rafters. The girl, Ellie (Elie Docter), helps him retrieve it, though Carl falls from a beam and breaks his arm. Ellie sneaks into his room that night and shows him her adventure book where she expresses a desire to one day move to the top of Paradise Falls in South America, showing him a picture that she \'ripped right out of a library book\'. She makes him promise that they will go together someday before leaving. A musical montage shows Carl and Ellie eventually getting married and moving into the old house where they first met. Their marriage is blissful and they get jobs as a balloon salesman and zookeeper, respectively. When they discover that Ellie is unable to have children, they make a pact to save money to travel to Paradise Falls. However, as the years pass, they are forced to dig into their Falls fund for other obligations. One day, an elderly Carl realizes that, despite living happily together, they never fulfilled their old promise and decides to surprise Ellie on a picnic with tickets to South America. However, Ellie\'s declining health puts her in the hospital and she eventually passes away, leaving Carl alone.\r\n\r\nCarl remains in his home, a retired and sour recluse, as the city grows around him. He is encouraged to move to a retirement home due to increased construction, but often argues with the foreman (John Ratzenberger) and refuses to leave. One day, he meets Russell (Jordan Nagai), a young wilderness explorer scout who attempts to assist Carl in order to earn his \'assisting the elderly\' badge. Carl tricks Russell into \'assisting\' him by telling him to find and get rid of a \'snipe\' that invades his yard. When a construction worker accidentally breaks Carl\'s mailbox, a part of the house and a part of Ellie that Carl cherishes, Carl hits him over the head with his walker. The assault lands him in court where he is forced to move out of his home by the next day. Workers from Shady Oaks retirement home arrive to pick him up the following morning but are shocked to find Carl releasing millions of helium balloons into the air which detach his house from its foundation, lifting it over the city and into the sky.\r\n\r\nComfortably away from the city, Carl sets a course for South America and rests in his chair until hes interrupted by a knock at the door. Upon answering, he discovers Russell hanging on to dear life on his porch; apparently, Russell had been snipe searching under Carls porch. Carl lets him in and decides to descend to return Russell home before a severe storm hits. The house is knocked around in the turbulence but Carl manages to tie most of his items down before falling asleep. He\'s woken the next morning by Russell, who tells him that they\'re over South America (thanks to a GPS device that he accidentally throws out the window), though the ground is hidden by a dense fog. Carl releases some balloons to descend but they hit ground early and are knocked out of the house. They manage to hold onto it using a hose attached to the porch while the fog lifts to reveal that they are standing on a high plateau opposite Paradise Falls. Unable to climb back into the house, they resolve to walk to the falls before the helium in the balloons lets out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a chase is progressing in the jungle. Three dogs with red lights on their collars are in hot pursuit of what appears to be a giant bird, but they lose the trail when their sensitive ears pick up the fine tuning of Carl\'s hearing aid. Russell stops to go to the bathroom and happens upon a giant bird which he lures closer with a chocolate bar. He introduces the colorful creature to Carl and gives it the name Kevin. Kevin follows them as they continue their journey but runs off when they approach the silhouette of a man who calls out to them. However, they see that the man is nothing more than a trick of the eye caused by overlapping stones. They are then approached by a golden retriever with a red light on his collar. Russell tells him to sit and speak and is surprised when the dog answers, using the device on his collar. He tells them his name is Dug (Bob Peterson) and that he is a tracker looking for a bird, at which point Kevin tackles him. The foursome continue their journey, Carl begrudging the additional company. At one point, Kevin loudly calls out and is answered by smaller calls. Dug says that Kevin is calling to her babies and Russell realizes that Kevin is a girl.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the three dogs seen chasing the bird earlier have picked up the scent of Carl and Russell, who they nickname the mailman. The leader Alpha (Bob Peterson), a doberman pinscher, tells Beta (Delroy Lindo), a rottweiler, and Gamma (Jerome Ranft), a bulldog, that they must be vigilant and continue their search. His speaking device appears to be damaged, causing him to talk in a high pitch. Using the device on Gamma\'s collar, Alpha calls to Dug, who they\'d sent on a false mission in order to get rid of him, but finds him in the company of the bird they\'d been after. They soon track him down and come upon Carl and Russell, but Kevin has already run off. Instead, they choose to take Carl and Russell to their master. Entering a large gorge, Carl and Russell meet a large pack of dogs, all with high-tech collars on, before meeting their master -- who turns out to be none other than an elderly Charles Muntz.\r\n\r\nMuntz invites them into The Spirit of Adventure as guests, but his behavior soon turns hostile when he finds out that Russell has adopted a new pet bird. Carl is shocked to see that Muntz has spent all the past years hunting for the bird which he was deemed a fraud for and has gone mad as a result. Muntz reveals a table of head mannequins wearing various headgear and grimly knocks each one off with his cane as he describes the stories their wearers told him; claiming that each one was actually after his bird. Carl and Russell run away from the zeppelin just as Muntz discovers the bird calling out from the roof of Carl\'s home. Riding on Kevin\'s back and assisted by Dug, who calls Carl his new master, they barely escape capture by Muntz\'s dogs, though Kevin is injured in the process. Carl agrees to help Kevin get back to her babies safely but, just before Kevin can re-enter her labyrinth home, a net flies out and captures her. Muntz and his dogs have arrived in the zeppelin, led to the spot by a tracking device on Dug\'s collar. Muntz throws a lantern beneath Carl\'s home, setting fire to it. Carl ignores Kevin and runs over to extinguish the flames as Muntz takes Kevin on board and leaves. Angry and disheartened, Carl yells at Dug and tells Russell that he\'s taking his home to Paradise Falls if it kills him. He manages to set his house down on the Falls, but loses Russell\'s respect for leaving Kevin.\r\n\r\nCarl goes inside the house and sits down to look at Ellie\'s adventure book. Saddened that she never got to see the Falls, he is about to close it when he discovers added pictures near the end, documenting their life together. On the last page is a note written by Ellie that says thanks for the adventure, now go have a new one! Enlightened and inspired, Carl goes outside in time to see Russell take off with a few balloons, using a leaf blower as propulsion. Carl empties his home of extra furniture, allowing it to become airborne once again, and follows Russell. He finds Dug on his porch and happily exclaims that Dug is his dog and he is his master. Russell manages to sneak aboard Muntz\'s zeppelin but is quickly caught and tied to a chair. Muntz sits him on the ships bomb-bay doors and flips the switch for them to open. Carl flies in and manages to rescue Russell in time, setting him inside the house while he goes into the zeppelin with Dug to fetch Kevin. Hes able to distract the guard dogs with a tennis ball from his walker and frees Kevin but is confronted by Muntz. They engage in a sword fight (albeit Carl uses his extended walker) while Russell, freed of his ties, fights off a squadron of dogs in fighter planes. He regains control of the house and returns to help Carl, who has climbed to the top of the zeppelin with Kevin. Dug has, meanwhile, faced off against Alpha and outsmarted him, effectively becoming the new alpha, and runs off to meet the others topside.\r\n\r\nKevin, Dug, and Carl run for the house which Russell has landed on the wing of the zeppelin, but Muntz appears with a rifle and shoots at them, causing the house to slip and dangle in the air. Carl struggles to hold onto the house with the hose while Muntz goes in after Kevin. Carl lures Kevin, carrying Dug and Russell, out of the house with chocolate and Muntz attempts to jump out of the window after them. He doesn\'t make the jump as his foot gets caught in some balloon strings and, weighing too much for the balloons to support him, he falls to his death. As Kevin, Dug, and Russell make it back to the zeppelin, Carl is forced to release his house, which slowly descends into the clouds, a loss which Carl accepts as being for the best.\r\n\r\nKevin is returned to her three chicks and Carl takes Russell and Dug home where Russell attends his senior explorer ceremony. When Russell\'s father fails to present him with his final badge, Carl fulfills the role and gives Russell a grape soda badge that Ellie gave him when they first met, calling it the Ellie badge. Afterwards, they sit on a curb together in front of an ice cream shop, Carl acting as a surrogate grandfather to Russell, The Spirit of Adventure anchored above them.\r\n\r\nAt Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie\'s house has landed right at the spot where it was meant to be: on the cliff overlooking the falls.', 'up.jpg', '2020-07-15 05:44:02'),
(2, '11 Types of Networks in Use Today', 'Network & types', 'Types of Networks', 'network-types', 'Convert To PDF\r\n\r\nUsed for everything from accessing the internet or printing a document to downloading an attachment from an email, networks are the backbone of business today. They can refer to a small handful of devices within a single room to millions of devices spread across the entire globe, and can be defined based on purpose and/or size.\r\n\r\nWe put together this handy reference guide to explain the types of networks in use today, and what they’re used for.\r\n\r\n11 Types of Networks in Use Today:\r\n\r\n1. Personal Area Network (PAN)\r\nThe smallest and most basic type of network, a PAN is made up of a wireless modem, a computer or two, phones, printers, tablets, etc., and revolves around one person in one building. These types of networks are typically found in small offices or residences, and are managed by one person or organization from a single device.\r\n\r\n2. Local Area Network (LAN)\r\nWe’re confident that you’ve heard of these types of networks before – LANs are the most frequently discussed networks, one of the most common, one of the most original and one of the simplest types of networks. LANs connect groups of computers and low-voltage devices together across short distances (within a building or between a group of two or three buildings in close proximity to each other) to share information and resources. Enterprises typically manage and maintain LANs.\r\n\r\nUsing routers, LANs can connect to wide area networks (WANs, explained below) to rapidly and safely transfer data.\r\n\r\n3. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)\r\nFunctioning like a LAN, WLANs make use of wireless network technology, such as Wi-Fi. Typically seen in the same types of applications as LANs, these types of networks don’t require that devices rely on physical cables to connect to the network.\r\n\r\n4. Campus Area Network (CAN)\r\nLarger than LANs, but smaller than metropolitan area networks (MANs, explained below), these types of networks are typically seen in universities, large K-12 school districts or small businesses. They can be spread across several buildings that are fairly close to each other so users can share resources.\r\n\r\n5. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)\r\nThese types of networks are larger than LANs but smaller than WANs – and incorporate elements from both types of networks. MANs span an entire geographic area (typically a town or city, but sometimes a campus). Ownership and maintenance is handled by either a single person or company (a local council, a large company, etc.).\r\n\r\n6. Wide Area Network (WAN)\r\nSlightly more complex than a LAN, a WAN connects computers together across longer physical distances. This allows computers and low-voltage devices to be remotely connected to each other over one large network to communicate even when they’re miles apart.\r\n\r\nThe Internet is the most basic example of a WAN, connecting all computers together around the world. Because of a WAN’s vast reach, it is typically owned and maintained by multiple administrators or the public.\r\n\r\n7. Storage-Area Network (SAN)\r\nAs a dedicated high-speed network that connects shared pools of storage devices to several servers, these types of networks don’t rely on a LAN or WAN. Instead, they move storage resources away from the network and place them into their own high-performance network. SANs can be accessed in the same fashion as a drive attached to a server. Types of storage-area networks include converged, virtual and unified SANs.\r\n\r\n8. System-Area Network (also known as SAN)\r\nThis term is fairly new within the past two decades. It is used to explain a relatively local network that is designed to provide high-speed connection in server-to-server applications (cluster environments), storage area networks (called “SANs” as well) and processor-to-processor applications. The computers connected on a SAN operate as a single system at very high speeds.\r\n\r\n9. Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)\r\nAs an alternative to traditional switch-based Ethernet LANs, POLAN technology can be integrated into structured cabling to overcome concerns about supporting traditional Ethernet protocols and network applications such as PoE (Power over Ethernet). A point-to-multipoint LAN architecture, POLAN uses optical splitters to split an optical signal from one strand of singlemode optical fiber into multiple signals to serve users and devices.\r\n\r\n10. Enterprise Private Network (EPN)\r\nThese types of networks are built and owned by businesses that want to securely connect its various locations to share computer resources.\r\n\r\n11. Virtual Private Network (VPN)\r\nBy extending a private network across the Internet, a VPN lets its users send and receive data as if their devices were connected to the private network – even if they’re not. Through a virtual point-to-point connection, users can access a private network remotely.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about which type of network is right for your organization, or want to learn more about Belden’s network solutions that improve uptime, maintain security, and help improve user access.', 'net.jpg', '2020-07-15 08:33:19'),

Be it Robots serving food to COVID-19 patients or the drones used for aerial surveillance, AI is not ready to leave its center stage. And it won’t cede the spotlight anytime soon.\r\n\r\nWe can very well say that ‘there’s virtually no major industry or organization left which is not using AI. Someway or other, they implement data-trained models of AI to effectively perform functions that often falls into the categories of machine learning or deep learning. Isn’t it?\r\n\r\nOrganizations across all sectors have started embracing AI and ML techniques to achieve better results. Tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon investing billions of dollars on AI products and services annually. Hence, it is evident that AI professionals will be in huge demand over the coming years.\r\n\r\nSo, all that we can say is, the AI revolution has just begun and its advances are only the beginning; there’s much more to come.\r\n\r\nI know we have spoken a lot about AI and its revolution….so basically what is AI???\r\n\r\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence?\r\n\r\nArtificial Intelligence is making intelligent computer programs that exhibit traits associated with a human mind such as learning or problem-solving. We are simulating human intelligence in machines by either programming them explicitly or not explicitly.\r\n\r\nBasically, it is based on the principle of defining human intelligence to a machine in order to easily mimic it and execute tasks, which includes the simplest to those that are pretty complex. So, the ultimate aim of artificial intelligence is to make Machines achieve learning, reasoning, and perception.     \r\nHow to build a career in AI?\r\n\r\nAI is continuously evolving and its applications are endless. Though its benefits being enjoyed among a myriad of industries, they still face the struggle to fill up the positions with strong AI skilled professionals.\r\n\r\nThe job site “Indeed” is saying that “the demand for AI skills has splurged more than double over the past three years, and the number of job postings is up by 119 percent.\r\n\r\nSo, what does this mean???\r\n\r\nBuilding a career in Artificial Intelligence will obviously reap better career benefits in the coming years.\r\n\r\nHow do I build one???\r\n\r\nEducational Requirements:\r\n\r\nTalking about educational requirements, the entry-level positions might require a bachelor’s degree. However, the leadership positions frequently ask for Masters. Apart from academics, aspiring professionals can take up various degree programs or certifications specific to AI which typically covers, coding knowledge, Robotics, Physics, Engineering, various levels of Math and Statistics, Bayesian Network, and cognitive science.\r\n\r\nWhat are the job roles available in AI?\r\n\r\nMachine Learning Engineer:\r\n\r\nOne of the popular AI job roles which are suitable for those with strong applied research and data science knowledge. Being a highly paid hot job, Machine Learning engineers need to apply predictive models and leverage natural language processing when wrangling the huge datasets. If you are applying for this role, then you need to have strong mathematical skills and sound knowledge in programming languages such as Java, Python, and Scala.\r\n\r\nBusiness Intelligence Developer:\r\n\r\nBusiness intelligence developer’s main role is to analyze the complex data sets to find out the market trends. Furthermore, they need to work on improving the efficiency and profitability of a business. Candidates applying for this role should have considerable experience in data mining, data warehouse design, SQL queries, SQL Server Integration Services, SQL Server Reporting Services, and Business intelligence technologies. They also should display strong problem-solving skills and communication skills.\r\n\r\nBig Data Engineer:\r\n\r\nBig Data Engineer is responsible for planning, designing, and developing the big data environment on Hadoop and Spark systems. So, aspiring individuals should hold a strong programming experience with Python, C++, Java, and Scala. Additionally, in-depth knowledge and experience in data visualization, data mining, and data migration is also required.\r\n\r\nResearch Scientist:\r\n\r\nResearch Scientist role demands extensive knowledge and experience in computer perception, reinforcement learning, graphical models, and natural language processing. They also need to be an expert in Machine Learning, Deep learning concepts as well as applied mathematics and computational statistics. Having an advanced master’s or doctoral degree in computer science would be the best fit for this role.\r\n\r\nData Scientist:\r\n\r\nData Scientists are data jugglers who collect, analyze, and bring insights from large, complex datasets by utilizing both machine learning and predictive analytics. This job role demands high experienced in statistical computing languages and programming languages with an educational background of a master’s degree or a doctoral degree in computer science.\r\n', 'ai.jpg', '2020-07-15 08:31:02'),
(4, 'What is Machine Learning?', 'Machine Learning', 'Machine Learning - definition.', 'ml-definition', 'Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut, using the classic algorithms of machine learning, text is considered as a sequence of keywords; instead, an approach based on semantic analysis mimics the human ability to understand the meaning of a text.\r\n\r\nSome machine learning methods\r\nMachine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.\r\n\r\nSupervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.\r\nIn contrast, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.\r\nSemi-supervised machine learning algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise, acquiring unlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.\r\nReinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.\r\nMachine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster, more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and resources to train it properly. Combining machine learning with AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more effective in processing large volumes of information.', 'ml.jpg', '2020-07-15 08:45:08'),
(5, 'PC - personal computer', 'Laptop and mini PCs', 'Various type of PCs.', 'personal-computer', 'There are two generally, similar and accepted meanings of the phrase personal computer (PC):\r\n\r\n1) PC is short for personal computer or IBM PC. The first personal computer produced by IBM was called the PC, and increasingly the term PC came to mean IBM or IBM-compatible personal computers, to the exclusion of other types of personal computers, such as Macintoshes.\r\n\r\n2) A personal computer (PC) may also refer to any small, relatively inexpensive computer designed for an individual user. In price, personal computers range anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. All are based on the microprocessor technology that enables manufacturers to put an entire CPU on one chip.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the term PC has become more and more difficult to pin down. In general, though, it applies to any personal computer based on an Intel microprocessor, or on an Intel-compatible microprocessor. For nearly every other component, including the operating system, there are several options, all of which fall under the rubric of PC.\r\n\r\nPCs at Home\r\nAt home, the most popular use for personal computers is for playing games. Businesses use personal computers for word processing, accounting, desktop publishing, and for running spreadsheet and database management applications.\r\n\r\nPersonal Computers in the Late 1970s\r\nPersonal computers first appeared in the late 1970s. One of the first and most popular personal computers was the Apple II, introduced in 1977 by Apple Computer. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, new models and competing operating systems seemed to appear daily. Then, in 1981, IBM entered the fray with its first personal computer, known as the IBM PC. The IBM PC quickly became the personal computer of choice, and most other personal computer manufacturers fell by the wayside.\r\n\r\nSince the first personal computer produced by IBM was called the PC, increasingly the term PC came to mean IBM or IBM-compatible personal computers, to the exclusion of other types of personal computers, such as Macintoshes, despite one of the few companies to survive IBM\'s onslaught was Apple Computer, which remains a major player in the personal computer marketplace today.\r\n\r\nIBM Clones\r\nOther companies adjusted to IBM\'s dominance by building IBM clones, computers that were internally almost the same as the IBM PC, but that cost less. Because IBM clones used the same microprocessors as IBM PCs, they were capable of running the same software. Over the years, IBM has lost much of its influence in directing the evolution of PCs. Many of its innovations, such as the MCA expansion bus and the OS/2 operating system, have not been accepted by the industry or the marketplace.\r\n\r\nPopular PCs of Today\r\nToday, the world of personal computers is basically divided between Apple Macintoshes and PCs. The principal characteristics of personal computers are that they are single-user systems and are based on microprocessors. However, although personal computers are designed as single-user systems, it is common to link them together to form a network. In terms of power, there is great variety. At the high end, the distinction between personal computers and workstations has faded. High-end models of the Macintosh and PC offer the same computing power and graphics capability as low-end workstations.', 'personal_pc.jpg', '2020-07-15 08:45:08'),

Companies are already experimenting with them to develop things like lighter and more powerful batteries for electric cars, and to help create novel drugs.\r\n\r\nThe secret to a quantum computer’s power lies in its ability to generate and manipulate quantum bits, or qubits.

(8, 'The Fault in Our Stars', 'Summary of the book', 'The Fault in Our Stars : A Book review by Ashutosh Mishra', 'review-the-fault-in-our-s', 'The Fault in Our Stars is a novel which tells the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16 year old girl who has had cancer for three years, and Augustus \'Gus\' Waters, a 17 year old boy who’s now in remission, and once had a tumour in his leg. The two fall hopelessly in love, even though they know their story will only end in heartbreak.\r\n\r\nHazel Grace Lancaster hasn’t experienced the \'awkwardness\' that is teenage life in three years after being diagnosed with cancer when she was thirteen. Forced by her mother, Hazel Grace reluctantly goes to a cancer support group to meet others who supposedly understand what she’s going through.\r\n\r\nThis bland and truly miserable support group is where she meets the charming, charismatic and unremarkably handsome Augustus \'Gus\' Waters, an amputee whose optimism towards life interests Hazel. Gus becomes immediately attracted to Hazel and, though the feeling is mutual, Hazel knows that their love is doomed from the start.\r\n\r\nHowever, Gus still charms Hazel. He changes her life by giving her, as she states: \'Forever within the numbered of days\' and changing her attitude towards life.\r\n\r\nThe two travel to Amsterdam to search for the author of their favourite book, \'An Imperial Affliction\', where their relationship blossoms and they learn that life, with or without cancer, is hard to face in general, and sometimes those who advise you to make daring and impulsive choices can’t always pluck up the courage to make their own.\r\n\r\nTheir \'little infinity\' reminds you that even the most heart-wrenching love story can be poetic, intelligent, humorous and full of positivity, even when you know there’s no chance of ever having a \'fairy-tale\' ending.\r\n\r\nJohn Green (also the author of bestsellers \'Looking For Alaska\', \'An Abundance of Katherines\' and \'Will Grayson, Will Grayson\') breaks your heart in the best possible way, and makes you cry, laugh, and smile throughout. Though he writes in an upbeat and light-hearted manner, you can still sense Hazel’s annoyance at life, which is endearing, as even though Hazel Grace is forced to be mature for her age, you can see she’s still just a grumpy, moody teen.\r\n\r\nWith a movie set to be released in June, Hazel and Gus have already captivated millions of hearts with their inspiring and engaging story. Even though many books have been cheapened by the movie, you can sense just by the trailer that this movie will live up to its expectations.\r\n\r\nShailene Woodley, an award winning actor, and newcomer Ansel Elgort, will star as the love-sick teens. I hope that they will portray the characters truthfully and honestly.\r\n\r\nThe Fault in Our Stars is one of those books you can’t stop reading, yet you never want it to end. It’s warm, light-hearted and deals with a sensitive topic like cancer in such an understated and subtle way. You feel it’s just one of life’s many problems and, even though it’s a very serious matter, Hazel and Gus teach you that you can’t let an illness like cancer affect your love for life.\r\n\r\nThis book is precious. It tells you that you can’t give up even when something is trying to stop you from enjoying a happy life. It’s a rare book that’s emotional and full of light.\r\n\r\nThe Fault in Our Stars is something that will appeal to everyone, as it pulls on your heart strings and makes you giggle. But most importantly, it makes you think about how valuable love is, how short a life can be, and how just one person can change your life in the most simple way.', 'FIOS.jpg', '2020-07-16 21:18:23'),
